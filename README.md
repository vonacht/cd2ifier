Automatic conversion of CD1 files to CD2.

Basic usage: ```cargo run -- <CD1-source-file> <CD2-target-file>```

where ```CD1-source-file``` is the path to the CD1 file that needs to be converted and ```CD2-target-file``` is the name and path where the result will be written to. 
The script accepts an optional ```-d``` flag to not pretty-print the output.
